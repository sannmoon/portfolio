          Hello, Iâ€™m Sandar <GiCyborgFace className="inline" /> a former
          accountant who made the leap into web development. In 2023, I decided
          to step away from the world of balance sheets to follow my true
          interests <GiCyberEye className="inline" />I wanted a career where I
          could build, create and solve problems, so I dedicated myself to
          learning code and developing my own projects.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I began with <TiHtml5 className="inline" /> and{" "}
          <MdCss className="inline" />.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I was studying, I also worked on ....
          <IoLogoReact className="inline" /> and I created pages and small
          applications. When I felt comfortable working with JS i went on to
          learn <IoLogoReact className="inline" /> As i went deeper into
          programming i wanted to do more than just front-end so i started
          learning , Express.js, MongoDB. I would also like to try React Native,
          as mobile apps are a more convenient way to use technology. Cause I
          believe people may prefer using apps over websites because they offer
          faster access, a more streamlined user experience, and can be easily
          accessed on the go.
